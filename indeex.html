    <p>Bangladesh is a small country with a huge population. The total area of Bangladesh is 147,570 square kilometers but the total population is more than 164 million. Still, it is a green and naturally beautiful country. Our country is growing economically and it is doing well in export too.

        We are the leader in world garments exporting right after china. Not only in the economy, but we also good at sports too. Our cricket team is one of the top seven teams in the world. Bangladesh has a very heart touching history behind. In 1971 this country got independence from Pakistan after a nine months war.
        
        Lots of people sacrificed their lives in that time. On 16 December the Pakistani army surrendered and we got a new nation. Thatâ€™s why we celebrate on 16 December as our Victory Day. Bangladesh is a very beautiful country with lots of natural spots to see. I love my country a lot.    </p>

        <p>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a very important person for the people of Bangladesh. He was born in a small village in Bangladesh in 1920.

            He loved his country very much and worked very hard to make it free from the bad rulers of Pakistan. He was a very good speaker and leader who helped the people to come together to fight for their rights.
            
            He is known as the father of Bangladesh because he led his country to become independent. Even though he is no longer with us, we still remember and honour him for his great contributions to our country.</p>

 <p>The National Flag of Bangladesh Paragraph; A national flag is generally the symbol of a free nation. Being a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. It symbolizes our national integrity, solidarity, and sovereignty. In 1971, we got our national flag through a bloody war against Pakistan. The size/ length and breadth of our national flag is 10:6. Its shape is rectangular. It is made of cotton, linen, or silk. It bears a combination of two colors. The major part of it is deep green. There is also a deep red round color part in the middle of it. It looks like the rising sun.

    The green color of our national flag stands for everlasting youth, freshness, and vigor of the whole nation. It also symbolizes the ever greenery of our beloved country. The red round part of our national flag symbolizes the rising sun of independence. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hopes, and aspiration for our youth. It is hoisted every day on our government offices and educational institutions. It is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. Besides, it is hoisted everywhere on independence day and victory day. We feel proud of our national flag.
