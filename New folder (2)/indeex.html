    <p>Bangladesh is a small country with a huge population. The total area of Bangladesh is 147,570 square kilometers but the total population is more than 164 million. Still, it is a green and naturally beautiful country. Our country is growing economically and it is doing well in export too.

        We are the leader in world garments exporting right after china. Not only in the economy, but we also good at sports too. Our cricket team is one of the top seven teams in the world. Bangladesh has a very heart touching history behind. In 1971 this country got independence from Pakistan after a nine months war.
        
        Lots of people sacrificed their lives in that time. On 16 December the Pakistani army surrendered and we got a new nation. Thatâ€™s why we celebrate on 16 December as our Victory Day. Bangladesh is a very beautiful country with lots of natural spots to see. I love my country a lot.    </p>

        <p>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a very important person for the people of Bangladesh. He was born in a small village in Bangladesh in 1920.

            He loved his country very much and worked very hard to make it free from the bad rulers of Pakistan. He was a very good speaker and leader who helped the people to come together to fight for their rights.
            
            He is known as the father of Bangladesh because he led his country to become independent. Even though he is no longer with us, we still remember and honour him for his great contributions to our country.</p>
